=========
Question 1: Structured English
=========

The program will take in a list of grades from a final exam and process 
the data to output the amount of grades, average grades, and the percentage 
of grades that are above the average grade.

The first part will read the text file using infile and make the data into a list of strings to  be able to format
them from python. You then take the list and make it into integers.

Then for the first calculation, the lens command will read the amount of
strings in the list and set it equal to total grades variable.

The next command will find the average by calculting the sum of the list and dividing it by the len.

and finally you will need to calculate the amount of integers that are above the average by using a for/in command.

Question 2: Pseudo Code
=========

use infile to open up final.txt
define grades variable to final.exe and format it into a string
close infile

use a for in command to convert the string of numbers to integers

get the number of grades by using grade len command

get the average by dividing sum by len for grades

get the amount of scores that are above average by testing each number and seeing if its greater than average.

print grade lens
print  average
print above average / total grades * 100
